I study JS with the site code.mu. The author is Trepachyov Dmitry. 
This is the progress that I have already made. 
I've started with arrays then returned back to the beginning and then continued with arrays. Days 17, 18 - (returned back Days 19) - continued up to arrays. Some exercices, which I find to be easy or repetitive, are not included here. However, you can find the answers to nearly all of the tasks. 

17.10 - 24 exercices done (arrays)
18.10 - 24 exercices done (objects)
19.10 - 36 exercices done (conditions + variables + operators) + git functioning 
20.10 - 54 exercices done (variables, operators, booleans, operations, decrement and increments) + branch merging with the main, branch deleted + VsCode funtioning + LivePort (HTML/JS docs)
